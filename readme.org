** Requirements
   + shell terminal or Python IDE
   + a positive attude when cleaning your room is a must!

** Desired Outcomes
   + Think more about organization, this leads to better design
   + Increase confort level of Utilizing REPL for developement
   + Basic understanding of directory/file manlipulations
   + Prep work for potential migration from shared linux account to
     Netwrok File System

** Tasks
   + Explore 'os' library and `os.path` module docs using the Python
